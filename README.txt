Install the plugin to accept FLIZ, the payment method that is free of fees for payers and shops alike.

== Description ==
## What does this plugin do for you

FLIZ is Germany's first fee-free payment method. Customers pay using the FLIZ App,
enabling you to accept payments without any fees.
Install the plugin now and embrace the ease of fee-free transactions.
You can receive your first transactions in less than 30 minutes!

### Use cashback to support your bottom line

Change your customers' payment behavior to ensure they use fee-free payment method FLIZ.
To achieve this, you can define a %-cashback that is deducted as a discount from every purchase your customers make with FLIZ.
This way, customers support your bottom line and optimize their own finances at the same time.

### Secure payments

FLIZ secures your transactions with complete end-to-end encryption, ensuring maximum security.
By processing payments through the SEPA network, each payment undergoes the same rigorous security checks
as any credit transfer within the EU.

FLIZ serves payers with a German bank account, while companies can receive payments across the EU.
